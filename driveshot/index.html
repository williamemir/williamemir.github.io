<h4>This is a simple google chrome extension</h4>
<p>It was made with the purpose of testing chrome extension creation with manifest v3.</p>
<p>It takes different types of screenshots of the current tab, and automatically saves to the user's google drive.</p>
<p>In the options you can set the drive folder id and shared drive id, if they're not set the screenshot is saved to the root of the google drive.</p>
